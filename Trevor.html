      <div id="item-2">
        <h4>How he got famous?</h4>
        <p>Trevor Henderson became famous through a viral surge in 2020, primarily driven by his character Siren Head and his "cursed images" style. The popularity of Siren Head was significantly boosted when prominent YouTubers like Markiplier and Jacksepticeye played a horror game based on the character, and his work gained widespread attention through "cursed image" compilations with millions of views on YouTube.</p>

      <div id="item-3">
        <h4>Cartoon cat</h4>
        <p>Cartoon Cat (personally my favourite character) is a hostile urban legend and cryptid created by Canadian horror artist Trevor Henderson. The character resembles a black-and-white feline from a 1930s-era "rubber hose" cartoon, with distorted and monstrous features.</p>

      <div id="item-3-1">
        <h5>Bridge Worm</h5>
        <p>Bridge Worm is an internet cryptid created by horror artist Trevor Henderson that hides under bridges. This massive, worm-like entity is known for its deception, luring victims with a pale, harmless-looking face. However, this innocent facade is actually a skin flap that peels back to reveal its true, horrifying visage, which is full of human-like teeth. In addition to its nightmarish face, it possesses immense strength and long, prehensile arms. The Bridge Worm is an aggressive ambush predator that stalks and consumes humans. It is one of many hostile species in the unsettling Trevor Henderson mythos.</p>

      <div id="item-3-2">
        <h5>Wandering Faith</h5>
        <p>Wandering Faith is a massive and mysterious cryptid from the Trevor Henderson mythos, often appearing during severe weather. As one of the cosmic "Giants," its purpose is to ascend worthy humans to a place assumed to be heaven using long, fleshy tendrils. Despite its benevolence, its immense, skeletal form with four long, multi-jointed legs and a neck that stretches into the clouds is terrifying to behold. While its gargantuan size causes inevitable destruction to the surroundings, Wandering Faith is not aggressive, acting solely as a collector of souls. It is one of several such entities that arrived on Earth through a dimensional rift involving a "second moon"</p>
