<h1>The Ancient Roman General:Julius Caeser </h1>
<h5>Early life</h5>
<p class="lead">
  Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family, <em>the gens Julia</em>, on 12 or 13 July 100 BC.The family claimed to have immigrated to Rome from Alba Longa during the seventh century BC after the third king of Rome, Tullus Hostilius, took and destroyed their city. The family also claimed descent from Julus, the son of Aeneas and founder of Alba Longa. Given that Aeneas was a son of Venus, this made the clan divine.This genealogy had not yet taken its final form by the first century, but the clan's claimed descent from Venus was well established in public consciousness. There is no evidence that Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section; such operations entailed the death of the mother, but Caesar's mother lived for decades after his birth and no ancient sources record any difficulty with the birth.
  <h5>contribution</h5>
  <p class="lead">
    As dictator, Caesar enacted numerous wide-ranging reforms designed to address social and governmental issues. These included debt relief, redistribution of land to the poor and his veterans, and the expansion of Roman citizenship to people in conquered provinces. He also initiated large-scale public works projects to create jobs and improve infrastructure. Perhaps his most enduring legacy was the Julian calendar, a sophisticated solar-based system that is the direct ancestor of the modern Gregorian calendar.

<h5>The Assassination of Julius Caesar</h5>
<p class="lead">
    Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator, was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC by a group of senators during a Senate session at the Curia of Pompey, located within the Theatre of Pompey in Rome. The conspirators, numbering between 60 and 70 individuals and led by Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus, and Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, stabbed Caesar approximately 23 times. They justified the act as a preemptive defense of the Roman Republic, asserting that Caesar's accumulation of lifelong political authority—including his perpetual dictatorship and other honors—threatened republican traditions.
